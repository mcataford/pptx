# pptx
Deep into the XML abyss

## Overview

This package takes a stab at PPTX manipulation out of curiosity for implementing against an open format and try to
produce a better, simpler and clearer version of existing solutions in the Python ecosystem.


## Development

This repository uses the [Scripts to Rule Them All](https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all) pattern; all the
utility scripts to manage dependencies, format and test are in the `script` directory. `. script/bootstrap` will install
the dependencies you need to get started.

## Contributing

Contributions are not expected until the layout / patterns / plans are a little more stable.
